# AccountSearching
Create an application that searches an array of objects. The application should lookup name and balance based on the account number according to the list shown. The data is to be stored as an array of objects (using a class definition) or an array of structured records. A sequential search should be used to locate the account number entered by the user. If the user enters an account number that is not in the array, the program should display a message indicating the account number is not in the list. If the user enters an account number that is in the list, the program should save the index (position) that the account number was found, and use that index to lookup the customer name and balance. The program is to display the customer account number, name and balance.
